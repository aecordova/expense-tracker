##expense_track

The objective of this feature is to be able to add a new expense to be persistent, ideally  an online database, however, lets keep it simple and try a file to start...


# All expenses need to be done by someone, taking money from somewhere, paying someone else
# So, we need to keep track of the person doing the expense, person information
# We need to have some sort of account information, balance and all that
# We need to especify who we paid, and why.
